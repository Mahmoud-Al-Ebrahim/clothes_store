    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/search/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/languages/
    # assets:
    #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:

  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito/Nunito-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito/Nunito-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito/Nunito-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito/Nunito-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
